Today we are excited to announce our next public Angular Master Class way up north in Denmark! We couldn't be happier to finally run our training in the country where [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) and [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg) were born!

The event takes place on the **20th to 22th June 2017 at Foss** in Hillerød about 35 km out of Copenhagen. We couldn't be happier to have [Foss](http://foss.dk) as a strong partner to help us bring our famous training to Denmark.

We will have three (3) days of fun and learning the ins and outs of Angular including things like

- Components and Modules
- Fetching data using Http
- Advanced Dependency Injection
- Basic Forms
- Observables deep-dive
- Architectural patterns
- ContentChildren and ViewChildren
- **Redux and ngrx**

...and many more!

Yes, that's right: This will be the first public training where we debut our brand new courseware on **Redux and ngrx**.
