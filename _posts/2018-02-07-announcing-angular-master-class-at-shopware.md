A few months have passed since our last Angular Master Class in Berlin, but now it's finally time again: In **June 2018** we are organizing a new Angular Master Class in Germany. 

We are thrilled to have found in **Shopware** the ideal partner and a first-class venue for an unforgettable event. Shopware is a leading e-commere company with a passionate, skilled and fun team to work with.

The facilities of Shopware in Schöppingen are modern, spacious and fancy and will be more than ideal for our Angular Master Class. 

The event will take place from **20th to 22nd June 2018** at Shopware in Schöppingen.

We will have three (3) days of fun and learning the ins and outs of Angular including things like

- Components and Modules
- Fetching data using Http
- Advanced Dependency Injection
- Basic Forms
- Observables deep-dive
- Architectural patterns
- Component communication
- ContentChildren and ViewChildren
- **ngrx**

...and much more!


During the day we will deepen our Angular knowledge together and at the end of the day we can have a nice time playing volleyball, table soccer and enjoy some delicious food.

This will be so much fun!
