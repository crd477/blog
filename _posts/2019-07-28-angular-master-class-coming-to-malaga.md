## Angular Master-Class Training

You may have noticed that we recently asked the Angular community where to host our next public Angular Master Class.

Today we are happy to announce that the community has decided: **We will come to MÁLAGA!**

It's been a while but now we are excited to finally hold another public Angular Master Class and bring it to the beautiful city of **Málaga in Spain this October**! We can’t wait for it!

We've also found a really great venue in Málaga that will set the right balance between work and fun: The [**Innovation Coworking Campus**](https://www.innovationcampus.biz)

We are sure this place will get everyone into the right state of mind to learn the nuances and power of Angular!
