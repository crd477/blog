Just a couple of weeks ago, we [announced to bring our Angular Master Class to Denmark](/announcements/2017/05/05/announcing-angular-master-class-in-denmark.html).

This will be a very special class for us as we are debuting our [brand new courseware](/angular/2017/05/08/angular-master-class-redux-and-ngrx.html) on **Redux and ngrx** for the first time in a public training.

If you haven't had a chance to grab one of the early bird tickets, you can still get one of the [regular tickets](https://amc-denmark.eventbrite.com/?aff=blogCommunityEvent).



### Join our free community event in the evening  

As mentioned in the initial announcement, we'll run a **free** event in the evening of **June 21st at 5:30 PM**.

The event takes place at the Auditorium at Foss. If you attend the training, you can simply follow us over to the Auditorium right after we finished the second day of the course.

For everyone joining the community event only, you'll find the Auditorium at the following address.


**Foss Allé 1**
<br>**3400 Hillerød**

**If you are not attending the *[Angular Master Class](amc-denmark.eventbrite.com)* training but plan to attend the meetup, please make sure to reserve a seat at our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/AngularJS-Copenhagen/events/240739296/?eventId=240739296&chapter_analytics_code=UA-68620812-1) to ease coordination**

### What's the theme?

The event will be focussed on short talks (5 - 20 min) with no strict guideline regarding topics. Anything from [Angular](https://angular.io), [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) to [Blockchains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) and [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning) is appreciated.

**Psst...first time speakers, this is your perfect chance**

- **Shahrzad (Sherry) Azimi : A migration story (AngularJS -> Angular)**

- **Shmuela Jacobs - Angular is on Fire(base)!**

- **Anders Aastrup Søborg : Why we replace a feature rich PC application, with an angular application**

- **Dominic Elm - Animations in Angular 4.2**

- **Christoph Burgdorf - Machine Learning for everyone**
