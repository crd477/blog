### Angular Master-Class Training

It's been almost 7 months since our last AMC training in USA: 
[Brooklyn, NY](https://blog.thoughtram.io/announcements/2016/08/30/announcing-angular-2-master-class-in-nyc.html).  

With help from Bonnie Brennan [Angular Meetup Houston](https://www.meetup.com/ngHouston/), we are very pleased to announce that our 
Angular Master Class is finally coming to **Houston, Texas** on **August 22 - 25, 2017!** 

And we found the perfect, artsy venue: Bisong Art Gallery, Houston Texas. 

<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bisong+Art+Gallery/@29.7682252,-95.3704114,14.27z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8640bf298647bd0d:0x78cc6f2afbb33e48!8m2!3d29.7675697!4d-95.35409?hl=en"

After all, fun places are sure to get everyone into the right state of mind to learn the 
nuances and power of Angular!

### About the Training

You or your team should attend our 4-day **Angular Master Class** training.

> Developers should note that this is the first time we have offered a public **4-day** training!
The reason we added another day is because we want to teach our brand new course material focused on  **Redux and ngrx**.

#### Training Schedule

*  Day 1: Jump Start with full, high-level introduction to Angular
*  Day 2: Observables & Component Architecture
*  Day 3: Routing & Forms
*  Day 4: Redux + ngrx with immutable, 1-way dataflows and reactive programming

These are intense, full 8-hour days... but don't worry, we make the classroom fun. thoughtram teaches the class with two (2) trainers. And almost every 30 minutes, students work with hands-on, coding lab exercises.

>  We have also updated our course and lab exercises to use Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout. You can read about that here: [Revamped Angular Master Class](https://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2017/01/08/a-revamped-angular-master-class.html).

We also have social time after class on Day 2 and Day 4. Leverage the social times for networking, offline questions, and simply relaxing with your fellow Angular-philes.
So come to our training, have a blast, and get the best acceleration into Angular possible. 

### On-Premise, Private Training?
